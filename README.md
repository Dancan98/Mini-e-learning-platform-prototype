📚 Mini E-Learning Platform

A simple, AI-assisted e-learning platform prototype built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project supports user login/signup, course browsing, and progress tracking through localStorage. It’s designed to demonstrate full-stack thinking in a frontend-only environment.

🚀 Features

🧑‍💻 User Login/Signup (with localStorage)

📘 View a List of Courses

🔍 Course Detail Viewer

✅ Mark Courses as Completed

🔐 User-Specific Progress Tracking

🔄 Logout Functionality

🎨 Simple, clean UI using HTML/CSS

🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML5

CSS3

JavaScript (Vanilla)

LocalStorage (for user data and progress)

🧪 How to Run

Download or clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/mini-e-learning-platform.git
cd mini-e-learning-platform


Open index.html in your web browser:

# On most systems, you can just double-click it,
# or use a simple local server like:
npx serve .


Create a user account by entering a username and password (this is saved locally).

Explore courses, view details, and mark them as completed.

📌 Notes

All user data is stored locally in the browser using localStorage.

This project is a prototype, not a production-grade application.

There's no backend — all logic runs on the frontend.

💡 Future Ideas (Optional Extensions)

Add course categories or tags

Integrate with a backend (Firebase, Node.js + MongoDB)

Add AI-generated quizzes or summaries

Improve UI/UX with Bootstrap or Tailwind

Add course video/audio support
